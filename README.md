### Notices
* I strongly recommend that you use Google Colab to train model as well as test.
* Download source code [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18kd8w70wANlQ8tSldH2aLy6SVO9YYz9s?usp=sharing).

*Source code will always be updated on Google Colab*

### Dataset
* [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) from Kaggle.
* Dataset is converted into CSV file for saving training time.
* The original dataset has 7 classes (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprised, neutral) but I have removed 'disgust' class and 'fear' one because these two expressions are not clear.

### Method
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has the architecture as below
   <img src="results/cnn-architecture.png" width="50%" height="50%">

* A callback function is set to stop training when accuracy > 72% and val_accuracy > 70% to avoid overfitting
* Here is the **model accuracy** plot and the **model loss** one

### How to use
1. Run **train_model.ipynb** if you want to train model from scratch. Otherwise, you can use my model including **fer.json** and **fer.h5**
2. Run **via_image.ipynb** to recognise on images
3. Run **via_webcam.ipynb** to test model on webcam. Actually, it just uses your webcam to capture and the images will be processed similar to **via_image.ipynb**
